## Overview

DropaDox is an **open source solution to cloud storage**.

It is a **full-stack site** built with **Nuxt.js, Tailwind, ShadCN, DrizzleORM, and SQLite**.

> An award-winning, open source first, easily deployable file storage platform made for **HackSLC 2025**.

The base site was originally built by the **four founders in under six hours** during the hackathon. That prototype became the foundation of the **DropaDox Genesis Project**, our first phase of ongoing development under the DropaDox organization.

## Origin Story

DropaDox was founded during **HackSLC 2025**.

Under time pressure, the four founders:

- Designed the core UX and data model.
- Built a **fully working full-stack Nuxt.js app** in under six hours.
- Wired file uploads, basic listing, and storage using SQLite and DrizzleORM.
- Shipped an open source first, easily deployable file storage platform.

What started as a hackathon sprint became a long-term open source project with a dedicated org and roadmap.
